# Hands-On Sessions

This folder is for the Hands-On Session. A hands-on session always cover a very specific topic and is always focused on a specific topic. If you are developing a hands-on session using any raw text format (R-markdown, Markdown slides, LaTeX etc.) then please feel free to create a branch and in it add a folder in this folder, name it after your topic, and start developing it there. Then submit a pull request when it is ready to be shared.

For more detailed information about our thinking behind Hands-on Sessions, please see our [Hands-on Sessions DropBox Paper](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Hands-on-Sessions--Abdr7q_kEizkOXqMfKBTot77Ag-NJFHU78WYuYmg3jdA9SIL)
