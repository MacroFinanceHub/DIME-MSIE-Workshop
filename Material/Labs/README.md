### Things to add to this Page
* The intention is that slides, exercises and everything else is saved here. Solutions to exercises should also be saved here.
    * The solutions are not hidden so these exercises should not be used as any kind of evaluation as they are free for anyone to browse.
* Please save as much as possible in non-binary format, i.e. .tex instead of .ppt or .pdf.
* Stata data files in the Stata tracks are a necessary exemption.
