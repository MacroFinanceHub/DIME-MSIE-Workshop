\begin{frame}{Why do we randomize?}

	\begin{itemize}[<default overlay specification>]
		\item<1> We want to assign the intervention of our projects so that the control group is as similar as possible to the treatment group as possible. 
			\newline - This is called a balanced treatment assignment. 
			\newline - Randomization is the most common tool to achieve that.
			\newline - With randomization, we know that the treatment is uncorrelated with the outcome ex ante.
		\item<1> Each observation needs to have the same probability to end up in the each treatment arm, and all groups need to be statistically similar. 
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Background?}

\begin{itemize}[<default overlay specification>]
	\item<1> Pure random assignment guarantees that the treatment and control groups, on average, will have identical characteristics. 
	\item<1> In any particular random allocation, the two groups will differ along some dimensions, with the probability that such differences are large, falling with sample.
		\newline - Confounders. 
		\newline - Efficiency (e.g. unequal group size). 
	\item<1> Small-scale experiments (30 to 100 observations). 
	\item<1> What options exist and what to do?
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Review: Balance tries to establish a counterfactual}
\begin{multicols}{2}	
	
	\textbf{What we know:}
	\newline Good randomization methods produce an unbiased estimate for treatment in the average randomization.
	
	\textbf{What we don’t know:}
	\newline Good randomization methods produce an unbiased estimate for treatment in the average randomization.
	
	\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=75mm]{img/Balance}
	\end{figure}
	
\end{multicols}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Pure RCTs are balanced – in the average assignment}

\begin{itemize}[<default overlay specification>]
	\item<1> No matter what statistics you are going by, if a (conditional) means difference has p=0.05, a difference of that size will be realized in 5\% of draws. That’s the definition.
	\item<1> The average randomized treatment assignment produces statistically identical groups across treatments.
	\item<1> But, a p=0.05 tail draws happen one time in 20. 
	\item<1> You only get one draw on your randomization!
	\item<1> We’d like balance tests to show ours was a “good” one, so that “real” differences must be due to treatment assignment.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Balance leads to unbiasedness: Need a model and an assumption}

\begin{itemize}[<default overlay specification>]
	\item<1> Model – Asymptotically normal OLS
		\newline - T-statistics of “closeness” to the average randomization depend on large-sample properties.
	\item<1> Assumption – no omitted variables in regression
		\newline Unless all x’s in X are in the model, balance on observables doesn’t imply that expected outcomes for treated and untreated are equal.
		\newline If you are wrong, biases are of unknown magnitude and direction depending on the omitted variable’s actual correlation with treatment and outcome variables (classical OVB).
		\newline In small samples especially, can’t guarantee that treatment randomization  produces zero expected differences for all omitted covariates.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{What we often do: block/stratify the experiment}
\begin{multicols}{2}	
	
\begin{itemize}[<default overlay specification>]	
	\item<1>  Meets our core criteria:
		\newline - Randomization process is fixed over real data.
		\newline - Counterfactuals (zero treatment effect) has a distribution that can be simulated exactly.
	
	\item<1>  Allows use of “randomization inference” statistics that do not depend on extrapolation from model.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Especially valuable when N is small:}
\begin{multicols}{2}	
	
	\begin{itemize}[<default overlay specification>]	
		\item<1>  Key idea:
		\newline - Reducing the number of possible randomizations to those where the treatment and control are intentionally similar reduces the possible variation in estimate of the true treatment effect.
		\newline - Moderate sample size reduces the advantage, but it depends critically on underlying dispersion of outcomes (Bruhn and McKenzie 2009).

\begin{frame}{Types of Randomization}

\begin{itemize}[<default overlay specification>]
	\item<1> Simple
		\newline - Each individual person is assigned either Treatment or Control with some probability.
	\item<1> Cluster
		\newline - Randomization happens on group level (village, school etc. ) and all individuals in a group are assigned the same treatment. 
	\item<1> Stratified
		\newline - Sub-sets of similar observations (rich/poor, male/female etc.) are determined in advance, and randomization is done separately within each sub-set. 
		\newline - Guarantees that equal number of similar observations (rich/poor, male/female etc.) are assigned to be each treatment and control.
	\item<1> Pairwise
		\newline - Extreme form of stratification. 
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Methods of randomization}

\begin{itemize}[<default overlay specification>]
	\item<1> Good:
		\newline - Field Based.
		\newline -Stata, especially via programming a randomization command. 
		\newline - R, Python, or other replicable software.
	\item<1> Never use:
		\newline - Excel – and other non-replicable software.
		\newline - Excel and many other software has random generators, but they do not allow a controlled randomization.

			\newline - Groups of different sizes: For example, assigning 40\% to control and 30\% to each of the two treatment arms.
			\newline - Clustering: Randomization is assigned to “clusters” of units at once, such as a household-level treatment.
			\newline - Stratification: Randomization within each subgroup in sample: male/female, rich/poor, regions, etc..
			\newline - Odd total sample size: The number of observations is not evenly divisible with the number of treatment arms in each strata. 
		\item<1>  What kind of code do these require to be random and reproducible?.
		\item<1>  \texttt{randtreat} is a user-written Stata command which can help handle all the issues above. We will practice this command in the exercise.

\begin{frame}{Stratified Randomization}

\begin{itemize}[<default overlay specification>]
	\item<1>  Ensures randomization achieves a balance re: several dimensions.
	\item<1>  Example: draw for the World Cup: 32 qualified countries grouped into 4 urns/strata  according to FIFA ranking and assigned to 8 different groups.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{But first . . . Cluster or stratum?}
\begin{multicols}{2}	
	
	\begin{itemize}[<default overlay specification>]
		\item<1>  Cluster: Units that are grouped and may share similar characteristics; sometimes used as the level of randomization (i.e., treatment assigned v. individual students).
			\newline - The advantage of cluster randomization is that it reduces the likelihood of treatment contamination, but requires more participants to achieve the same statistical power.

		\item<1>  Strata: Groups made up of individuals sharing the same characteristics (i.e., females, males) from which a random sample is drawn.
			\newline - Ensures balance across treatment groups with respect to stratifying variables. Makes it possible to draw inferences about outcomes within each group.

\begin{frame}{Guiding Principles }

\begin{itemize}[<default overlay specification>]
	\item<1>  Maximum number of strata depends on the sample size, the expected size of each strata and the importance of the stratification factors.
	\item<1>  According to simulations, between 22 and 48 strata for a sample size of 100 seems appropriate (individual level randomization). 
	\item<1>  Select covariates that are strongly related to the outcomes of interest, such as geographic region dummies, and variables for which subgroup analysis is desired.

	\begin{itemize}[<default overlay specification>]
		\item<1>  Assignment of 2,802 households to the 5 treatment groups and the control group.
		\item<1> Each HH has the following probabilities of being selected to receive each treatment:
			\newline - T1: Productive bonus: 200/2802 (7.1\%) (= 0)
			\newline - T2: Simple savings account: 800 / 2,802 (28.6\%) (= 1)
			\newline - T3: Account plus paired subsidy: 300 / 2,802 (10.7\%) (= 2)

			\newline - T5: Account plus grant + training: 350 / 2,802 (12.5\%) (= 4)
			\newline - T6: Control: 800 / 2,802 (28.6\%) (= 5)
	   \item<1> The last two homes are assigned at random to T1-T6.

\begin{frame}{Background}

\begin{itemize}[<default overlay specification>]
	\item<1>  Random number tables have been used for a long time. Nowadays, computational random number generators are employed.

	\item<1>  Stata’s random-number generation functions, such as uniform(), follow deterministic algorithms that are pseudorandom-number functions. 
	\item<1>  The sequences these functions produce are determined by the seed.
	\item<1>  Different seeds produce different sequences.
