# Data set to use during Workshop

While it is not important which data we are using as any data we are using is de-identified, it is important that the same data is used across all labs and to the extent applicable and/or possible also in the lectures and hands-on sessions.


### Things to be added to this page
* Each lab track should start with one data set, and by completing all the exercises
    * It is ok to save intermediate data sets so that someone that did not manage to complete a previous exercise can still do the current exercise.
