# Data set to use during Workshop

In this folder the data-master-dofile.do will create the data sets to be used in the MSIE Workshop. Do not use the 2018 dtaa sets, they are the starting point for the data sets in this folder, but di not use them.

While it is not important which data we are using as any data we are using is de-identified, it is important that the same data is used across all labs and to the extent applicable and/or possible also in the lectures and hands-on sessions.


### Things to be added to this page
* Each lab track should start with one data set, and by completing all the exercises
    * It is ok to save intermediate data sets so that someone that did not manage to complete a previous exercise can still do the current exercise.
